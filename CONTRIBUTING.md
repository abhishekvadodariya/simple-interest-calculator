A code of conduct can be an important part in establishing an inclusive culture, but it is not a comprehensive solution on its own. 
An ethical culture is created by the organization's leaders who manifest their ethics in their attitudes and behaviour.
[6] Studies of codes of conduct in the private sector show that their effective implementation must be part of a learning process that requires training, consistent enforcement, and continuous measurement/improvement:[7] 
simply requiring members to read the code is not enough to ensure that they understand it and will remember its contents.[8] Castellano et al.
describe Tom Morris' book If Aristotle Ran General Motors as "compelling" and "persuasive" in arguing that in addition to codes of conduct and ethical guidelines, 
the creation of an ethical workplace climate requires "socially harmonious relationships" to be embedded in practice.[9] 
The proof of effectiveness is when employees/members feel comfortable enough to voice concerns and believe that the organization will respond with appropriate action.[10]
